PiDrive image
=============

This is simple repo that contains Makefile to build and prepare everything you
need to get your PiDrive running. It has some nontrivial dependencies, like
git, qemu-user for arm, squashfs-tools and you have to be able to get root.
Maybe more, feel free to send a pull request with fixed documentation.

Simply checkout the repo, run make and copy content of SD directory to your SD
card. Plug it into your PiDrive and you should be good to go.
